Particle Simulations
====================

Simulations made in Unity that feature particles<br>
Some of these simulations include
- Natural Selection Simulator
- Social Credit Simulator

## Natural Selection Simulator
- This is a working simulation of a two level Predator and Prey scenario. Both species will evolve slowly and develop new stratagies for survival
- The downloadable simulation can be found inside the [Builds](https://github.com/Crabo-7498/Particle-Simulations/tree/main/Natural%20Selection%20Simulator/Builds) folder, or here on [Itch.io](https://crabo-7498.itch.io/natural-selection-simulator)
- A web version of the simulator can be found [here](https://crabo-7498.itch.io/natural-selection-web)
